      <description>I have been working for a startup company in a few months. Our product is a web site where people can write and read posts with their mind flow by a mindmap-like interface. The most of my job is to visualize log, helping ourselves to understand how users use our web site. Meanwhile, I also do some temporary tasks like adding a few seed data, or writing scripts for sending email to people in the early period.</description>
